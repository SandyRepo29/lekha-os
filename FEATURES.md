| **REST API v1** | 32 endpoints — full CRUD for audits/findings/CAPAs/risks/treatments/reviews/contracts + Trust Score™ + Control CSV exports + Trust Intelligence™ (overview, org-score, recommendations) + policies + privacy · Bearer token auth + bcrypt key validation + in-memory rate limiting |
| **Audit logging** | Every meaningful mutation logged to `audit_logs` with actor, action, entity, metadata, ip_address |
| **DB** | Drizzle ORM, lazy Proxy init, Supabase Postgres pooler, `ssl:"require"`, **82 tables** across 17 migrations — all applied |
